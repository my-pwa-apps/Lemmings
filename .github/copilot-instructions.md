# Lemmings Clone Project

This is a web-based clone of the classic Lemmings game using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS. All game assets are procedurally generated in code without using external image files.

The project focuses on:
- Procedural generation of game elements (lemmings, terrain, etc.)
- Canvas-based rendering for the game
- Physics and collision detection for lemmings
- Game logic similar to the original Lemmings game
