# Level 1 Strategy Guide

## How to Win Level 1

1. **Press D key** to enable debug mode - this will show the gap location.

2. **Select Builder ability** (press 5) and click on a lemming just before it reaches the gap.

3. The builder will create a bridge section, then you'll need to make another lemming continue building until you reach the other side.

4. You need to save 5 out of 10 lemmings to win the level.

## Key Controls
- D: Toggle debug mode (shows gap)
- 5: Select Builder ability
- P: Pause the game
- +/-: Change game speed (slow down near the gap)

## Tips
- Make bridges wider by assigning multiple builders in sequence
- If lemmings turn around on the bridge, create a more robust bridge with additional builders
- You have 3 builder abilities - use them wisely!
